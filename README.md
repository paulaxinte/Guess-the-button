# Guess the button

This project is a guessing game, where the user is given 3 buttons and he has to press the correct button to win the game. If he presses an incorrect button, then he can try again until he presses the correct button.

From the moment that the page is loaded, one of the 3 buttons is selected to be the correct one and its ID is stored in a variable. After that, when the user presses one of the buttons, a function is run to verify if the pressed button's ID matches the correct button's ID. If it does, the message "You win!" is shown in green font colour; but if it doesn't, then the message "Wrong button. Try again!" is shown in red font colour.

For this project, I used JavaScript.
